A message receiver task T1-r1 is created, reflecting that after submitting the order, the system awaits confirmation or further information in response to the order submission from the user.\n- Task T2 (\"System processes the order\") is classified as an 'action' as it describes an activity performed by the system.\n- Task S1 (\"initial of User\") is an 'action' as it marks the start of the user's involvement in the process.\n- Task E1 (\"end of User\") is also an 'action', indicating the conclusion of the user's role.\n- Task S2 (\"initial of System\") is an 'action', representing the start of the system's role in the process.\n- Task E2 (\"end of System\") is classified as an 'action' as it signifies the ending of the system's processing activity.\n\nNo timer tasks were created since there were no tasks involving waiting for a time-based event.

Identify the approximate causal origin of the response task.\n2. Generate a new message receiver task for the response task, indicating reception of that message.\n\nChain Causality and Multi-Effect Handling:\n- If a single prior behavior causes multiple downstream tasks by another actor, treat each as an independent response.\n- Causal chains indicated by temporal expressions (e.g., \"before\", \"after\", \"until\"), conditional logic, or inferred dependencies should all be captured.\n- Each response task must independently receive a message receiver task, even if they relate to the same prior condition.\n\nActor Role Constraint:\n- Only generate message receiver tasks if the sender and receiver belong to **different actors**.\n- Do not model intra-actor transitions (i.e., when a task by Actor X causes another task by Actor X).\n\nReceiver Symbol Derivation Clarification:\n- The message receiver task symbol must always be derived from the **response task**, not from the causal or sender task.\n- For example, if Task T6 is a response to a previous trigger, then generate T6-r1, not T5-r1.\n\nNaming:\n- The receiver task symbol is derived from the response task's symbol by appending -r1, -r2, etc.\n- Ensure uniqueness against ALREADY_GENERATED_TASKS; increment suffix if necessary.\n\nSemantic Source Labeling:\n- The second element in each task triplet (i.e., sender_task_symbol) should be a symbolic semantic label, such as \"T6-related\" or \"T8-related\".\n- This label describes the approximate causal or triggering relation for the response task, not a literal task ID.\n- Use the pattern: <response_task_symbol>-related.\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn a single JSON object with two fields:\n1. \"tasks\": a list of objects with actor_symbol, semantic_relation_label, and task_symbol fields\n2. \"task_types\": a list of objects with task_symbol and message receiver fields\n\nExplanation:\n- For each receiver task, explain why the response was interpreted as caused by a prior interaction.\n- Justify actor roles, suffix choices, and semantic label use.\n\nRequirements:\n- Analyze the **entire REQUIREMENT**, not just the first triggering pair.\n- Output all valid response-based receiver tasks that follow the inter-actor communication pattern.\n\nPlease output the results in standard JSON format. Do not use string representations or tuple notation. Use proper JSON objects and arrays.\n\nOutput format requirements:\n- tasks: JSON array of objects with actor_symbol, semantic_relation_label, and task_symbol fields\n- task_types: JSON array of objects with task_symbol and message receiver fields\n- symbol_pattern: <response_task_symbol>-r<number>\n- detection_criteria: causal_response_to_previous_actor, temporal_dependency_between_tasks, semantic_trigger_from_other_actor\n- deduplication:\n  - reference_list: ALREADY_GENERATED_TASKS\n  - strategy: skip_if_exists_or_increment_suffix\n",

This relationship indicates that the System's processing (T2) is a response to the prior action of the User submitting the order.\n   \n2. **Actor Roles**: Since the task performed by the System (Task T2) is a reaction to an action performed by the User (Task T1), it adheres to the requirement of having different actors for sender and receiver tasks.\n\n3. **Suffix Choice**: The message receiver task symbol is derived from the response task symbol T2 by appending \"-r1\", as it's the first receiver task associated with Task T2.\n\n4. **Semantic Labeling**: The semantic relation label \"T1-related\" provides context that Task T2 is causally linked to the action of the User submitting the order, which is essential to understanding the flow of the process.\n\n5. **Deduplication**: The response task (T2-r1) was evaluated against ALREADY_GENERATED_TASKS to ensure it does not conflict with existing task symbols.
